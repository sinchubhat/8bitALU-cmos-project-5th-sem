8 bit ALU 
Description:

8 bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is a combinational digital electronic circuit. The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on, called Operands. ALUâ€™s output is the result of the performed operation.

It has 2 inputs A and B each of which are 8-bits. It also has a 1-bit control signal M. It produces addition or subtraction of the two inputs based on the control signal.

Functionality:

The circuit produces result A+B when M=0 and A-B when M=1.

Technology used:
DSCH , Microwind

This has both transistor level circuit and layout.
